## Project Structure

- All common things (project-wide, global) are placed in the `src` directory. This includes components, types, styles, and utility functions. This is where we put things that are shared across the project.
- In the project wide components, we have `ui` directory that contains atomic design components like `Button`, `Tag`. Outside of the `ui` directory, there are components composed of atomic components like `Header`, `Footer`.
- In the `app` directory we have domains/features. This includes components, types, hooks, api (route handler) ... that are only used in that domain/feature. Basically these directories include things similar to the global things but are only used in the domain/feature.
- The project uses Next.js App Router to handle routing. The router is divided into two groups: `auth` and `unauth`. The `auth` group contains routes that require authentication, while the `unauth` group contains public routes.
